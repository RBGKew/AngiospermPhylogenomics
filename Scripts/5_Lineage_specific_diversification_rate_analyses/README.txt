scripts for lineage specific diversification rate analyses. bamm_input.bamm is the inputs file for the analyses performed in BAMM. Within this file comments indicate where to adjust the number of expected diversification rate shifts (10 or 100), and the input tree (young or old). set_priors.R is used to set the priors for the bamm analyses. branch_specific.Rev is for branch specific diversification analyses in RevBayes. Comments indicate where to change the input tree (young or old) and the expected number of diversification rate shifts (10 or 100).
